description: Overview of Forge and how it turns product intent into execution-ready tickets.
---

Forge streamlines the path from product intent to validated, code-aware, execution-ready tickets across the backend, frontend, and supporting services. The platform keeps architecture rules front and center so teams can ship changes without drifting from standards.

### What you will find here
- What Forge is and why it exists.
- How to get your environment running quickly.
- Where to plug into the monorepo for backend, frontend, and shared packages.

### How the docs are organized
These docs start with a high-level overview, then walk you through getting the project running locally. They are intentionally concise so you can move from reading to building fast.

Continue with [Getting Started](/getting-started) for setup steps, or read [What is Forge](/what-is-forge) to understand the product’s goals and principles.
