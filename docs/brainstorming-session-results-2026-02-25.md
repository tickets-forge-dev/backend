# Brainstorming Session Results

**Session Date:** 2026-02-25
**Facilitator:** Business Analyst Mary
**Participant:** BMad

## Session Start

**Approach:** Progressive Technique Flow (broad → narrow)
**Techniques Selected:**
1. First Principles Thinking — Strip to fundamental truths
2. Assumption Reversal — Flip every belief and find hidden strategy
3. Alien Anthropologist — Outsider perspective on the entire space
4. Chaos Engineering — Stress-test surviving ideas against worst cases

**Sequence Rationale:** Truth → Challenge → Perspective → Stress-test

## Executive Summary

**Topic:** Forge's competitive survival, identity, and differentiation strategy in the AI era

**Session Goals:** Identify defensive moats, offensive positioning, and core identity that makes Forge win against Jira, Linear, and AI-native ticket generation (e.g., Claude shipping structured tickets natively)

## Technique Sessions

### Technique 1: First Principles Thinking (Partial — session paused for implementation)

**Key Insights Uncovered:**

1. **The real problem isn't tracking work — it's that the handoff between intent and execution is broken.** PMs have ideas, developers get half-sentences, hours wasted reverse-engineering intent.

2. **Forge isn't a ticketing system. It's a contract negotiation engine.** The AEC (Agent Execution Contract) is the core — a verified, structured agreement between the person who wants something and the person (or agent) who builds it.

3. **The AEC ownership model:** PM drafts intent → Forge asks AI-driven questions → Ticket moves to "Dev-Refine" → Developer enriches with code context via their tools (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf) → Developer marks ready for review → PM approves → AEC is forged → Execution.

4. **Two enrichment paths exist:** Best path is developer enrichment via CLI/MCP. Easy path is auto-enrichment via Git connection from the web UI. Both are valid, developer path produces superior results.

5. **The AEC should be a first-class citizen** — not a section within a ticket, but the primary artifact the entire lifecycle produces. The ticket is the vehicle. The AEC is the product.

6. **The AEC is designed for both human and agent execution** — machine-readable instructions that an AI agent can pick up and run autonomously.

**Session paused to implement website changes based on these insights.**
