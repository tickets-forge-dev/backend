## 📧 LINKEDIN TEMPLATES

### Template 1: Cold LinkedIn Message (Short & Direct)

**Subject:** Quick question about PRD breakdowns

**Message:**
```
Hey [First Name],

Quick question: How much time do you spend breaking down PRDs/projects
into actionable tickets for your dev team?

I'm building a tool that auto-generates tickets from PRDs in 30 seconds
(acceptance criteria, dependencies, priorities).

Would this save you time? If yes, can I show you a 5-minute demo?

Best,
Dan
```

**Why this works:**
- Opens with a question (gets engagement)
- Clear value prop (30 seconds, not manual)
- Low commitment ask (5-minute demo)

---

### Template 2: LinkedIn Connection Request

**Message:**
```
Hey [First Name]! Saw your post about [topic]. I'm building a tool for
Engineering Managers to automate PRD → ticket breakdowns. Would love to
connect and get your feedback!
```

**Why this works:**
- References their content (shows you're not spamming)
- Clear reason for connecting
- Asks for feedback (not selling)

---

### Template 3: LinkedIn Message (Warmer, for connections)

**Subject:** Need your feedback on a tool for EMs

**Message:**
```
Hey [First Name],

I'm building something for Engineering Managers and would love your take.

The problem: Breaking down PRDs into Jira tickets takes 2-4 hours per project.

The solution: Forge analyzes your PRD + codebase, generates 5-10 tickets
with acceptance criteria, priorities, and dependencies in 30 seconds.

Example:
- Input: "Add user authentication with OAuth"
- Output: 8 tickets ready for Jira (backend, frontend, tests, docs)

Does this solve a real pain for you? If yes, can I show you a quick demo?

Thanks!
Dan
```

**Why this works:**
- Problem → Solution format
- Concrete example (they can visualize it)
- Specific output (8 tickets for Jira)

---

### Template 4: Follow-up (No Response After 2 Days)

**Message:**
```
Hey [First Name],

Following up on my message about PRD → ticket automation.

I know you're busy, so here's a 30-second video showing what it does:
[Loom link]

If it's not relevant, no worries! Just let me know.

Best,
Dan
```

**Why this works:**
- Acknowledges they're busy
- Gives them video (lower friction than reading)
- Easy out (reduces pressure)

---

## 💬 SLACK COMMUNITY TEMPLATES

### Template 5: Slack Message (Lenny's Newsletter, Mind the Product)

**Channel:** #engineering-management or #product-tools

**Message:**
```
Hey everyone! 👋

Quick question for Engineering Managers:

How much time do you spend breaking down PRDs/epics into Jira tickets
each week?

I'm exploring a tool that would automate this (paste PRD → get 5-10
tickets with acceptance criteria in 30 seconds).

Would this save you time? Or is this not a real pain point?

Honest feedback appreciated! 🙏
```

**Why this works:**
- Asks community permission (not spammy)
- Open-ended question (gets discussion)
- Validates pain before pitching

---

### Template 6: Slack DM (After Community Response)

**Message:**
```
Hey [First Name]!

Saw your comment in #engineering-management about PRD breakdowns taking
forever. That's exactly the problem I'm solving.

Would you be open to a 5-minute demo? I'd love to show you what I'm
building and get your feedback.

Here's a 30-second preview: [Loom link]

Let me know!

Dan
```

**Why this works:**
- References their specific comment (personalized)
- Offers value (demo + feedback)
- Includes video (shows you're legit)

---

## 📞 DEMO CALL SCRIPTS

### Script 1: Opening (First 30 Seconds)

**You say:**
```
Hey [Name]! Thanks for hopping on.

Before I show you anything, let me ask: How do you currently break down
PRDs into tickets? Walk me through your process.

[Listen to their answer - this is KEY]

Got it. So it sounds like [summarize their pain]. Is that right?

Cool. Let me show you what I'm building - it should solve exactly that.
```

**Why this works:**
- Listens first (builds rapport)
- Confirms their pain (validates you understand)
- Sets up demo as solution to THEIR specific problem

---

### Script 2: Demo (2 Minutes)

**You show:**
1. **Screen 1:** "Here's a sample PRD for user authentication"
2. **Screen 2:** "I paste it into Forge, click 'Generate Tickets'"
3. **Screen 3:** "30 seconds later, I have 8 tickets ready for Jira"
4. **Screen 4:** "I can edit them inline, drag to reorder, add/delete"
5. **Screen 5:** "Click 'Create in Jira' → all 8 tickets appear"

**You say:**
```
That's it. PRD → tickets in 30 seconds. No manual work.

How would this fit into your workflow?

[Listen - they'll tell you what's missing or what they love]
```

**Why this works:**
- Fast (2 minutes, not 10)
- Concrete (they see real output)
- Asks for feedback (gets buy-in)

---

### Script 3: The Ask (Last 2 Minutes)

**After they say they like it:**

**You say:**
```
Awesome! Glad it resonates.

So here's where I'm at: I'm building this over the next 2 weeks.
It'll be ready Feb 24.

Pricing is $29/month. Does that feel fair for saving 2-4 hours per project?

[If they say yes:]

Perfect. I'm looking for 10 founding users. You'll get lifetime 50% off
($15/month) for being early.

Can I add you to the list? I'll send early access when it's ready.

[If they say no:]

No worries! What would make it a no-brainer for you?

[Listen - this is gold. Adjust your product/pricing based on feedback]
```

**Why this works:**
- Clear timeline (they know when to expect it)
- Anchors high ($29), gives discount ($15)
- Binary question (yes/no, not "maybe")
- Collects "no" feedback (helps you iterate)

---

## 🎯 QUALIFYING QUESTIONS

### After Demo, Ask These:

**Question 1: Usage Frequency**
```
How often do you break down PRDs? Weekly? Monthly? Per quarter?
```

**Why:** If they say "once a quarter", they won't pay $29/month. If "3x per week", they will.

---

**Question 2: Current Solution**
```
What do you use today? Manual Jira? ChatGPT? Something else?
```

**Why:** If they're happy with ChatGPT, you need to differentiate. If manual, easy sell.

---

**Question 3: Team Size**
```
How many developers are on your team?
```

**Why:** Bigger teams = more pain = higher willingness to pay. Also helps with pricing strategy later.

---

**Question 4: Budget Authority**
```
Do you have budget to buy tools like this, or would you need approval?
```

**Why:** If they need 3 layers of approval, they're not a good early customer. Find decision-makers.

---

**Question 5: Willingness to Pay**
```
If this saved you 2-4 hours per week, what would you pay per month?
$10? $30? $50? $100?
```

**Why:** Tests price sensitivity. If they say "$10", your pricing is too high. If "$100", you're undercharging.

## 📝 TIPS & TRICKS

### 1. **Use Video**
Record a 30-second Loom showing the concept. Gets 3x more responses than text alone.

### 2. **Personalize First Line**
Reference their LinkedIn post, company, or recent work. Shows you're not copy-pasting.

### 3. **Ask, Don't Tell**
"Would this save you time?" beats "This will save you time."

### 4. **Lower Friction**
"5-minute demo" beats "30-minute call". Make it easy to say yes.

### 5. **Follow Up**
80% of responses come from 2nd or 3rd follow-up. Don't give up after 1 message.

### 6. **Track Everything**
Use a spreadsheet. Review daily. What's working? What's not? Iterate fast.

### 7. **Qualify Hard**
Don't waste time on "maybes". Find people who say "YES, TAKE MY MONEY" in Week 1.
