# Epic 1: Foundation - Retrospective

**Date:** 2026-01-31
**Epic:** 1 - Foundation
**Team:** Bob (SM), Alice (PO), Charlie (Senior Dev), Dana (QA), Elena (Junior Dev), BMad (Project Lead)
**Status:** Complete (2/2 stories done)

---

## Epic Summary

**Delivery:**
- Completed: 2/2 stories (100%)
- Story 1.1: Project Setup and Repository Initialization
- Story 1.2: Design System - shadcn/ui Setup with Linear-Inspired Minimalism

**Quality:**
- Build status: ✅ Successful
- Type checking: ✅ No errors
- Production incidents: 0
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility: ✅ Verified

**Technical Deliverables:**
- 10 shadcn/ui components installed
- 57 design token CSS variables
- 5 page templates (auth, tickets, settings)
- Theme switching system (System/Light/Dark)
- Linear-inspired minimalism enforced

---

## Key Lessons Learned

### What Went Well

1. **Design System Foundation Strong** - 57 design tokens provide consistent foundation for all future UI work
2. **Theme System Robust** - No flash on load, OS detection working, smooth transitions
3. **Page Templates Reusable** - Clear patterns established for tickets, settings, auth flows
4. **Architecture Compliance** - All files follow CLAUDE.md standards (src/, PascalCase, path aliases)
5. **Clean Delivery** - Both stories completed with no production incidents

### Challenges Encountered

1. **Route Conflict** - Initial implementation had duplicate page.tsx files causing Internal Server Error
   - Learning: Route groups like `(main)` don't create URL segments
   - Fix: Removed duplicate, server now working

2. **Partial Story 1.1** - Story 1.1 marked done but no formal story file exists
   - Story completed directly in code without workflow
   - Created continuity gap for Story 1.2 (no learnings to reference)

### Technical Debt

1. **Firestore Theme Sync** - Deferred to Epic 2.x+
   - Theme preference currently localStorage only
   - Cross-device sync requires authentication (Epic 2 dependency)
   - Priority: Low (localStorage works, sync is enhancement)

---

## Next Epic Dependencies

**Epic 2: Ticket Creation & AEC Engine** requires from Epic 1:
- ✅ shadcn/ui components (button, input, textarea, badge, card, dialog)
- ✅ Design tokens system
- ✅ Page templates (tickets list, detail, create)
- ✅ Theme system

**All Epic 1 dependencies satisfied.**

## Preparation for Epic 2

### Critical Setup Needed

1. **Backend NestJS Setup**
   - Clean Architecture folder structure (presentation/application/domain/infrastructure)
   - Feature modules: tickets/, shared/
   - Repository pattern base classes
   - Owner: Charlie (Senior Dev)

2. **Firebase Backend Integration**
   - Firebase Admin SDK configuration
   - Firestore repositories (FirestoreAECRepository)
   - Auth guards and workspace isolation
   - Owner: Charlie (Senior Dev)

3. **Zustand Store Implementation**
   - tickets.store.ts with service injection pattern
   - Store actions for createTicket, updateTicket
   - Owner: Elena (Junior Dev)

4. **Mastra Agent Setup**
   - LLM content generator interface (ILLMContentGenerator)
   - Mastra integration in infrastructure layer
   - 4 agents: intent extraction, type detection, drafting, question generation
   - Owner: Charlie (Senior Dev)

### Parallel Work Opportunities

- Stories 2.1 and 2.2 (frontend UI) can start while backend setup is in progress
- Frontend components can use mock data initially

---

## Action Items

### Process Improvements
- [ ] Create story files for all stories going forward (learned from 1.1 gap)
- [ ] Document learnings in Dev Agent Record for continuity

### Team Agreements
- Use formal story workflow for all future stories
- Architecture compliance mandatory (CLAUDE.md standards)

---

## Retrospective Status

**Epic 1 Retrospective:** ✅ Completed
**Epic 1 Status:** ✅ Complete - Ready to proceed to Epic 2
**Significant Changes:** None - Epic 2 plan remains valid
**Blockers:** None

---

**Next Steps:**
1. Begin Epic 2 preparation (backend setup)
2. Run `/bmad:bmm:workflows:epic-tech-context` for Epic 2
3. Draft Story 2.1 when backend foundation ready
