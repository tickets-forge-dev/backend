# Sprint Status Tracking - Executable Tickets (forge)
# Generated: 2026-02-02
# Project: forge
# Project Key: forge
# Tracking System: file-system
# Story Location: {project-root}/docs/sprint-artifacts

# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic exists in epic file but not contexted
#   - contexted: Epic tech context created (required before drafting stories)
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - drafted: Story file created in stories folder
#   - ready-for-dev: Draft approved and story context created
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation
#   - review: Under SM review (via code-review workflow)
#   - done: Story completed
#
# Retrospective Status:
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - completed: Retrospective has been done
#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Epics should be 'contexted' before stories can be 'drafted'
# - Stories can be worked in parallel if team capacity allows
# - SM typically drafts next story after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', SM reviews, then Dev moves to 'done'

# Recent Activity (2026-02-05):
# =================================
# Story 9-7: Iterative Question Refinement Workflow
# - Phase 1 (Domain Foundation): COMPLETE ✅
#   * Created QuestionRound value object
#   * Extended AECStatus enum (4 new statuses)
#   * Enhanced AEC entity (3 new fields + 4 new methods)
#   * Updated AEC Mapper (backward compatible)
#   * Extended TechSpecGenerator interface (3 new port methods)
#
# - Phase 2 (Backend Use Cases): COMPLETE ✅
#   * StartQuestionRoundUseCase (with LLM retry logic)
#   * SubmitAnswersUseCase (with decision logic)
#   * SkipToFinalizeUseCase (user manual override)
#   * FinalizeSpecUseCase (final spec generation)
#
# - Phase 3 (TechSpecGenerator Implementation): COMPLETE ✅
#   * Implemented generateQuestionsWithContext() - Round-aware question generation
#   * Implemented shouldAskMoreQuestions() - LLM decision logic with hard stop at R3
#   * Implemented generateWithAnswers() - Final spec with answer context
#   * Created TechSpecGeneratorPort with injection token
#   * Updated use cases to import from port
#
# - Phase 4 (API Endpoints): COMPLETE ✅
#   * POST /tickets/:id/start-round - Start question round
#   * POST /tickets/:id/submit-answers - Submit answers + decide action
#   * POST /tickets/:id/skip-to-finalize - User manual skip
#   * POST /tickets/:id/finalize - Generate final spec
#   * Created DTOs: StartRoundDto, SubmitAnswersDto
#   * Updated controller response mapping with new fields
#
# - Phase 5 (Frontend Store Extension): COMPLETE ✅
#   * Extended WizardState with questionRounds[], currentRound, roundStatus
#   * New actions: startQuestionRound, answerQuestionInRound, submitRoundAnswers, skipToFinalize, finalizeSpec
#   * Auto-save to localStorage for tab switching recovery
#   * resumeDraft() for session recovery from Firestore
#
# - Phase 6 (Frontend UI Updates): COMPLETE ✅
#   * Created QuestionRoundPanel component with collapsible rounds
#   * Modified Stage3Draft.tsx to integrate question round flow
#   * Updated TicketList.tsx with draft badges and round progress indicator
#   * Smart navigation: draft tickets resume wizard instead of detail view
#   * Skip confirmation dialog with UX warning
