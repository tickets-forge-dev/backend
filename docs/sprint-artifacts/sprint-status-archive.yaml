# BMM Sprint Status - Forge Project
# Generated: 2026-02-09
# Project: forge
# Project Key: FORGE
# Tracking System: file-system
# Story Location: docs/sprint-artifacts

# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic exists in epic file but not contexted
#   - contexted: Epic tech context created (required before drafting stories)
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - drafted: Story file created in stories folder by *create-story
#   - ready-for-dev: Draft approved and story context created by *story-ready
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation by *dev-story
#   - review: Implementation complete, ready for review by *code-review
#   - done: Story completed by *story-done
#
# Retrospective Status:
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - completed: Retrospective has been done by *retrospective
#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Epics should be 'contexted' before stories can be 'drafted'
# - Stories can be worked in parallel if team capacity allows
# - SM typically drafts next story after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', SM reviews, then Dev moves to 'done'

  # ============================================================================
  # EPIC 25: PRD BREAKDOWN WORKFLOW (Team Planning - PRD → Multiple Tickets)
  # Status: Backlog
  # Priority: P1 (Strategic pivot to team planning tool)
  # Effort: ~2-3 weeks
  #
  # STRATEGIC CONTEXT:
  #   - Moves Forge upstream from single-ticket enrichment to project planning
  #   - Bigger time save: PRD breakdown (2-4h) + ticket specs (1h each) = 7-14h per project
  #   - Different buyer: Appeals to PMs and tech leads, not just individual devs
  #   - Waves approach: Create simplified tickets → User enriches individually
  #
  # SCOPE DECISIONS:
  #   ✅ Waves approach: Fast breakdown (2-3s) → Bulk create drafts → Enrich one-by-one
  #   ✅ Reuse existing question engine for individual ticket enrichment
  #   ✅ No spec feedback loop (keep it simple)
  #   ✅ Just paste PRD text (no Notion/Confluence connectors for MVP)
  #
  # BMAD INTEGRATION:
  #   - Adapts logic from .bmad/bmm/workflows/2-plan-workflows/create-epics-and-stories/
  #   - Mastra agent uses proven BMAD prompts for epic grouping & story breakdown
  #   - Output: Forge tickets instead of markdown files
