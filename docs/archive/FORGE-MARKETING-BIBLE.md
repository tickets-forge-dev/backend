# Forge Marketing Bible

*The definitive guide to Forge — one document you need to know by heart.*

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**Forge** transforms loose product ideas into validated, code-aware, execution-ready tickets for Jira and Linear. Instead of writing detailed specs manually, users describe what they want to build, and Forge automatically generates comprehensive technical specifications with acceptance criteria, file changes, API endpoints, test plans, and estimated effort — all informed by your actual codebase.

## 🔥 Why Forge Is Needed (The Problem)

### The Current Pain

1. **Specification Hell**: Teams spend hours or days writing detailed specs for new features
   - Product managers struggle to be technical enough
   - Developers have to fill in gaps themselves
   - Back-and-forth feedback loops waste time

2. **Context Switching**: Building specs requires jumping between tools
   - PRD → Design → Codebase → Jira/Linear
   - Information gets lost in translation
   - Specs drift from reality as code evolves

3. **Disconnected from Code**: Most specs don't understand your actual architecture
   - File locations are wrong
   - API endpoints don't match reality
   - Database schema assumptions fail
   - Estimated effort is wildly off

4. **Manual Ticket Creation**: Creating tickets is repetitive and error-prone
   - Copy-pasting acceptance criteria
   - Forgetting to add test cases
   - Missing acceptance criteria
   - No connection to related work

### The Forge Solution

✅ **AI-Powered Specs** — Claude analyzes your actual codebase and generates contextual specs
✅ **Code-Aware** — File paths, APIs, and architecture match your real project
✅ **Acceptance Criteria** — BDD-formatted (Given/When/Then) and testable
✅ **Bulk Ticket Creation** — Generate 10-100 tickets from a PRD in seconds
✅ **Jira/Linear Integration** — Export directly to your issue tracker
✅ **Refinement Loop** — Ask clarifying questions and regenerate specs instantly

## 🏆 The Hardest Q&A (Questions You'll Definitely Get)

### Q1: "Isn't AI-generated specs going to be wrong/generic?"
**The Real Concern**: Specs won't match our codebase or will be useless hallucinations

**Best Answer**:
> "That's the #1 question we got. Here's why Forge works:
>
> 1. **Code-Aware**: Forge reads your actual codebase—file structure, tech stack, patterns
> 2. **Iterative**: Users ask 3-5 clarifying questions, AI refines the spec each time
> 3. **Testable**: All acceptance criteria are BDD format (Given/When/Then)—if the spec is wrong, tests catch it immediately
> 4. **Human Editing**: Generated spec is a *starting point*, not gospel. Engineers always refine
>
> Think of it like: Forge writes the first draft that's 80% done. Your team edits the last 20%."

---

### Q2: "How is this different from ChatGPT or Claude?"
**The Real Concern**: Why not just use ChatGPT directly? What does Forge add?

**Best Answer**:
> "You *could* use ChatGPT, but you'd have to:
>
> 1. Copy-paste your codebase into the prompt (ChatGPT has context limits)
> 2. Answer the same clarifying questions over and over
> 3. Manually format BDD criteria
> 4. Copy-paste into Jira/Linear
> 5. Store specs somewhere (where do they live? Slack? Google Docs? Version control?)
>
> Forge automates all of that. It's ChatGPT + workflow integration + codebase context + iteration.
>
> **The real value isn't AI—it's context + workflow.**"

---

### Q3: "What if the AI generates a spec that's technically impossible?"
**The Real Concern**: Will engineers waste time reading bad specs?

**Best Answer**:
> "Two things prevent this:
>
> 1. **Codebase Context**: Forge reads your actual architecture. If something is impossible, it tends to know
> 2. **Question Loop**: The AI asks 'Can you clarify this part?' before generating—catches misunderstandings early
>
> And honestly? Even if 10% of specs are off, that's OK. An 80% finished spec is better than no spec.
>
> **Our users report that 90%+ of generated specs are immediately actionable. The rest need 1-2 edits.**"

---

### Q4: "How do you keep costs down with Claude API calls for every spec?"
**The Real Concern**: Will this be expensive to run? Pricing model sustainability?

**Best Answer**:
> "Good question. We use Claude because it's both smart AND cost-effective:
>
> 1. **Streaming Analysis**: We don't send your entire codebase. Forge streams and fingerprints it (~1-2 seconds analysis)
> 2. **Smart Caching**: Repeated analyses (same repo, same patterns) use cached fingerprints
> 3. **Pricing Model**: We take a small cut of Claude's cost + value-add. Users pay per spec (not per API call)
>
> **Math**: A 2-hour spec-writing session costs ~$0.50 in Claude API. We make money on velocity, not usage."

---

### Q5: "What about our security/proprietary code? Does Forge see all our source?"
**The Real Concern**: IP leakage, confidentiality, code exposure

**Best Answer**:
> "This is critical. Here's how we handle it:
>
> 1. **You Control What's Shared**: Forge only analyzes the files YOU tell it to (not your entire repo by default)
> 2. **No Training Data**: Specs and code are never used to train models or improve Forge
> 3. **Enterprise Plan**: For $X/mo, we offer self-hosted or VPC-only deployment
> 4. **Encrypted in Transit**: All data is encrypted end-to-end
>
> **The standard answer: 'Treat Forge like you treat ChatGPT—don't paste secrets. But we're building enterprise SOC2 compliance.**"

---

### Q6: "Our PRDs are already perfect. Why would we use this?"
**The Real Concern**: Feature creep/unnecessary tool for mature teams

**Best Answer**:
> "Totally fair. If your current workflow works, don't change it. Forge is for teams saying:
>
> - 'We spend too much time on specs'
> - 'We ship slower than we'd like'
> - 'We're losing context between PRD and code'
> - 'We just scaled and don't have time for perfect specs'
>
> Forge isn't about perfect specs. It's about **faster specs**.
>
> **If you're the exception—your specs are genuinely perfect and fast—you don't need Forge.**"

---

### Q7: "How is this better than template-based ticket systems?"
**The Real Concern**: We already have Jira templates, why buy another tool?

**Best Answer**:
> "Templates are static. Forge is dynamic:
>
> - **Templates** = 'Here's the format, you fill it out'
> - **Forge** = 'Tell me what you want, AI understands your codebase and auto-fills 80% of it'
>
> Templates work if you're creating the same type of ticket 100 times. Forge works better when every ticket is different (new feature, bug fix, refactor).
>
> **We actually integrate with Jira/Linear—we're not replacing them, we're supercharging them.**"

---

### Q8: "What happens if Forge gets shut down?"
**The Real Concern**: Vendor lock-in, data loss, what happens to my specs?

**Best Answer**:
> "Great question. We're committed to:
>
> 1. **Data Portability**: All your specs export as JSON/Markdown anytime
> 2. **API-First**: You can build your own integration if needed
> 3. **No Proprietary Format**: Specs are stored in standard formats, not vendor lock-in
> 4. **Open Source Roadmap**: Long-term goal is open-source core (after we're profitable)
>
> **Your data is yours. Forge is a tool, not a prison.**"

---

### Q9: "Can I use this for non-software work? (Design specs, marketing campaigns?)"
**The Real Concern**: Feature creep—is this just a general spec generator?

**Best Answer**:
> "Forge is *optimized* for software engineering specs. We read code, understand APIs, predict file changes. That's our superpower.
>
> Could you force it to work for design? Maybe. But you'd be fighting the tool.
>
> **Our focus: be the best at technical specs, not mediocre at everything.**"

---

### Q10: "How do you make money if most of our usage is free?"
**The Real Concern**: Business model—is this sustainable? Will pricing spike?

**Best Answer**:
> "Our pricing model:
>
> - **Free**: 3 specs/month (enough to try it)
> - **Pro**: $12/mo (30 specs) — individual PMs, small startups
> - **Team**: $59/mo unlimited — for 5+ team members
> - **Enterprise**: Custom pricing + SOC2, VPC deployment, custom integrations
>
> We make money from power users. If you're generating 100+ specs/month (Team tier), we've already paid for ourselves in your time savings.
>
> **The math: One 2-hour spec saved = $100+ in labor. We charge $0.40/spec for that.**"

## 🚀 Elevator Pitches (Use Situationally)

### 30-Second Version (At a Coffee)
> "We use AI to turn rough product ideas into bulletproof technical specs in minutes. Reads your actual codebase, generates acceptance criteria, test plans, everything. Exports directly to Jira or Linear."

### 2-Minute Version (Sales Call)
> "Most teams waste hours writing detailed specs. We automate that. You describe what you want to build, Claude analyzes your codebase, and we generate a comprehensive spec with acceptance criteria, file changes, APIs, test cases—all informed by your architecture.
>
> Users then answer 3-5 clarifying questions, and the spec auto-refines. In about 10 minutes, you have something that would take engineers 2+ hours to write.
>
> We integrate directly with Jira and Linear. Free tier is 3 specs/month—enough to see the value."

### Startup/Founder Version
> "If you're a solo founder or lean PM wearing all hats, Forge is your AI PM. Paste your idea. Get a complete spec ready to hand to engineering. That 2-day planning session becomes 20 minutes."

### Engineering Team Version
> "Your product specs are vague. Forge makes them specific. It reads your actual codebase—knows your file structure, tech stack, patterns—and generates specs that match reality. Then you ask clarifying questions, and it refines. Specs are usually 90% ready to hand to a developer."
