# Forge in 40 Sentences
## The Complete Product Story

1. Forge is an AI-powered technical specification generator that transforms how engineering teams write tickets.

2. It solves a universal problem: engineers and product managers spend hours writing incomplete, ambiguous specifications that confuse developers and slow down shipping.

3. Today, writing a single engineering ticket takes 45 minutes and still leaves the developer with 10 clarifying questions.

4. Forge cuts that to 5 minutes and includes everything a developer needs: acceptance criteria, API changes, test plans, and file-by-file implementation guidance.

5. The workflow is simple: connect your GitHub repository, describe the feature you want to build, and Forge does the technical analysis.

6. Forge reads your codebase—understanding your technology stack, architecture patterns, file structure, and dependencies—without ever modifying your code.

7. It uses advanced AI to detect which files will change, which APIs need to be modified, and what database migrations are required.

8. Within seconds, Forge generates a complete engineering specification organized by architectural layer: backend changes, frontend changes, shared types, infrastructure, and documentation needs.

9. Every specification includes a problem statement that explains the "why" behind the feature.

10. Every specification includes a solution section that describes the architectural approach and trade-offs.

11. Every specification includes acceptance criteria written in Given/When/Then format—eliminating ambiguity about what "done" means.

12. Every specification includes a test plan: unit tests, integration tests, and edge cases that QA needs to verify.

13. Every specification includes detected API endpoints, with methods, routes, request payloads, and response shapes.

14. Every specification includes a quality score (0-100) that tells you how complete and well-structured the spec is.

15. If the quality score is below 90, Forge asks clarification questions to improve the specification.

16. These questions are context-aware: "Should users be able to upload custom avatars or use defaults?" or "What's the maximum file size allowed?"

17. Users answer up to 5 clarification questions, and Forge regenerates the spec with higher quality.

18. The final specification is developer-ready: clear, complete, and executable without back-and-forth.

19. Forge is built for multiple personas: Product Managers who need to generate specs without writing technical details, Engineering Leads who need to validate and refine specs, and Developers who consume specs and turn them into code.

20. Non-technical PMs can use Forge without GitHub access by describing their feature and picking a tech stack from presets.

21. Technical teams connect their actual GitHub repositories for code-aware analysis that's 10x more accurate than manual writing.

22. Every generated specification can be exported directly to Linear or Jira—or copy-pasted as Markdown anywhere.

23. When you export to Linear, the entire spec (description, acceptance criteria, test plan, file changes) flows into a single Linear issue with proper formatting.

24. When you export to Jira, Forge maps sections to Jira fields: acceptance criteria become subtasks, test plans become linked epics, and the full spec attaches as a document.

25. For teams using neither Linear nor Jira, you can copy the Markdown specification and paste it into Slack, Notion, Google Docs, or anywhere your team collaborates.

26. Forge respects your project's rules: it detects CLAUDE.md files, ESLint configurations, and project guardrails, then ensures generated specs comply with those rules.

27. This means specs generated by Forge won't violate your architecture principles or coding standards—they're already aligned with how your team builds.

28. Forge scales with your team: the Free tier includes 5 tickets per month, perfect for trying it out.

29. The Pro tier ($19/month) unlocks unlimited tickets, priority analysis, and faster generation.

30. The Team tier ($49/month per seat) includes team workspaces, role-based access, multi-repository support, and integrations with all major tools.

31. Enterprise customers get self-hosted options, custom LLM configurations, dedicated support, and SLA guarantees.

32. Pricing is usage-based and transparent: you only pay for the tickets you generate, and there are no hidden fees.

33. Security is built in: Forge uses OAuth for GitHub authentication, never stores your code, and encrypts all specifications in transit and at rest.

34. Your data is yours: you can export specifications in multiple formats, and you can delete your account and all associated data anytime.

35. The vision for Forge is bigger than just ticket generation: it's to become the operating system for technical specification across the entire software development lifecycle.

36. Future versions will include a "Codebase Explorer" that lets non-technical PMs ask questions about your architecture ("Where does payment handling live?" or "Can we support multi-currency?") and get answers grounded in actual code.

37. Future versions will support multi-repository features: specify a feature that touches your client, backend, and shared packages simultaneously, and Forge generates a unified spec with cross-repository dependency detection.

38. Future versions will include automatic architecture documentation: Forge will analyze your codebase and generate living documentation that stays in sync with your actual code.

39. The biggest insight behind Forge: the best specifications come from understanding actual code, not guessing at implementation details—and AI is uniquely positioned to analyze code at scale and extract that understanding instantly.

40. Forge is not about replacing engineers or removing technical thinking from product development; it's about automating the tedious parts (writing, organizing, formatting) so engineers can focus on solving hard problems and building products that matter.
