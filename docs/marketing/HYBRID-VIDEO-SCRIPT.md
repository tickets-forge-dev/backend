## VOICEOVER SCRIPT (Complete)

Copy this for your voiceover recording:

```
[INTRO]
"Forge turns your code into complete engineering specs in minutes. Here's how to use it."

[SECTION 2]
"Step 1: Connect your GitHub repository. Forge reads your code to understand your tech stack, architecture, and patterns. We never modify your code."

[SECTION 3]
"Step 2: Describe the feature you want to build. Give Forge as much context as you can. Mockups, designs, feature description — the richer the input, the better the spec."

[SECTION 4]
"Step 3: Forge analyzes your repository. In seconds, Forge generates a complete, developer-ready specification."

[SECTION 5]
"Step 4: Review the generated spec. You'll see a clear problem statement that explains the 'why'. How to build it — architectural approach. Acceptance criteria in Given/When/Then format — no ambiguity. Every backend change needed, organized by file. Every frontend change, with exact components and hooks. Complete test plan so QA knows what to verify."

[SECTION 6]
"Step 5: Forge asks clarification questions to improve the spec. Better questions equals better specs. Questions are optional but recommended."

[SECTION 7]
"Step 6: Export your spec to where your team actually works. Whether you use Linear, Jira, or copy-paste — your spec is instantly ready for your team."

[CLOSING]
"That's it. From idea to dev-ready spec in minutes. Try Forge free. No credit card required. 5 tickets a month to start. Start building faster."
```

**Record Tips:**
- Speak naturally (not robotic)
- Pause between sections (let viewers absorb)
- Emphasize key phrases: "developer-ready", "complete specification", "no ambiguity"
- Do 2-3 takes per section, pick the best one
- Record in quiet room, no background noise

- [ ] **Version A:** 7-minute comprehensive video (ready for YouTube + landing page)
- [ ] **Version B:** 3 modular videos (ready for YouTube playlist)
- [ ] **Social Clips:** 4 short videos (TikTok, Instagram, Twitter)
- [ ] **YouTube Playlist:** Linked, with proper descriptions

## ONE MORE THING

**Record the voiceover AFTER you edit the screen footage.**

Why? You'll know the exact timing of each section, and you can pace your voiceover to match the visuals perfectly. Record sections in order, take breaks between.

---

## GO EXECUTE THIS

You have everything you need. Shoot it this week, edit next week, live by the following week.

The hybrid approach gives you:
- ✅ The full story (7 min for people who want depth)
- ✅ Modular learning (3 parts for people who want bite-sized)
- ✅ Social clips (30-45 sec for TikTok/Twitter virality)

All from one shoot.

Let me know when you're filming and I can help with any on-the-fly adjustments!
