## SHOT LIST (In Order of Filming)

### SCENE 1: CONFUSION SETUP
**Location:** Desk facing camera
**Time:** 10 minutes

| # | Shot | Description | Duration | Notes |
|---|------|-------------|----------|-------|
| 1A | Wide | PM at desk, looking at screen | 3 sec | Natural pose, slight confusion on face |
| 1B | Close-up | PM's face, blank stare at monitor | 2 sec | Capture frustration, thinking |
| 1C | Medium | PM typing "Add user avatar" | 3 sec | Get hands in frame, typing naturally |
| 1D | Close-up | PM's face after typing (satisfied for a sec, then doubt) | 2 sec | Micro-expression: "Wait, is that enough?" |

**What to Say (1C dialogue, natural tone):**
> "Okay, we need to add a user avatar. How hard can it be?"
> *[types]*
> "Done. Boom."

**Director Notes:**
- Multiple takes (do 3-5, pick best)
- PM should be genuinely thinking/confused
- Let natural hesitation show (don't be too polished)

---

### SCENE 2: THE PROBLEM
**Location:** Same desk
**Time:** 10 minutes

| # | Shot | Description | Duration | Notes |
|---|------|-------------|----------|-------|
| 2A | Screen recording | Slack notification pops up | 3 sec | Pre-record this + add in post, OR simulate with another phone |
| 2B | Medium | PM sees Slack, reads it, face falls | 2 sec | Act confused, slightly panicked |
| 2C | Close-up | PM's reaction (defeat) | 2 sec | Genuine "oh crap" moment |
| 2D | Montage | Quick rapid cuts (stacking clips in edit) | 5 sec total | See breakdown below |

**Montage Shots (2D) — Film Each Separately:**
- PM looking at GitHub on monitor (confused scrolling, 2 sec)
- PM on Zoom call (narrate: "Is this backend or frontend?" — 1 sec)
- PM back at desk, head in hand (2 sec)
- Timer on screen showing "45 minutes elapsed" (add in post)

**Production Notes:**
- For Slack message: Screenshot PM's actual Slack, or use your phone to show notification
- For GitHub shot: Open your actual repo, scroll confused
- For Zoom: Can film alone, just act like you're listening to someone off-camera
- All dialogue is optional here — voiceover will cover it

---

### SCENE 3: THE REVEAL — HERO MOMENT
**Location:** Same desk + screen recording
**Time:** 15 minutes (most important scene)

| # | Shot | Description | Duration | Notes |
|---|------|-------------|----------|-------|
| 3A | Medium | PM opens new tab, hopeful | 2 sec | "Wait... what if I just paste the repo?" (dialogue) |
| 3B | Screen recording | Typing repo URL into Forge | 2 sec | Paste: `github.com/owner/repo` |
| 3C | Screen recording | "Analyzing..." animation | 3 sec | Show the fingerprint/analysis happening |
| 3D | Screen recording | **SPEC APPEARS** — all sections visible | 5 sec | SLOWLY REVEAL: this is the money shot |
| 3E | Close-up | PM's genuine reaction to spec | 3 sec | Eyes widen, smile, relief |
| 3F | Screen recording | PM scrolling through spec sections | 3 sec | Show: problem statement → acceptance criteria → API endpoint → test plan |
| 3G | Close-up | PM reading (amazed) | 2 sec | "It has... everything?" (optional dialogue) |

**CRITICAL: 3D & 3E are your hero shots**
- Let spec reveal slowly (not instant)
- Capture genuine PM reaction (this is what people remember)
- Quality Score badge should be visible (92/100)
- All section headers should be legible

**Dialogue (Optional, Feel Natural):**
> "Wait... it has the backend endpoint... the database schema..."
> *[scrolls]*
> "...test cases? This is... this is actually good."

**Screen Recording Specifics:**
- Use ScreenFlow (Mac) or Camtasia to record Forge interface
- Set screen resolution to 1920x1080 (scales well)
- Record at 60fps, export as 4K if possible
- Have Forge pre-loaded with a mock spec ready to display
- Have GitHub repo open in background (if visible)

**Dialogue (5B):**

## DETAILED SHOOTING ORDER

**Do NOT film in script order. Film by location & setup to save time.**

### SETUP PHASE (30 min)
1. Set up camera on tripod
2. Adjust lighting (window + ring light if needed)
3. Audio test (record 10 sec of PM speaking)
4. Monitor check (frame PM, white balance, exposure)
5. Have PM sit and get comfortable

### SHOOT PHASE (90 min)

**Block 1: All Desk Shots (70 min)**
- Scenes 1A-1D (Confusion setup): 10 min
- Scenes 2B-2C (Reaction shots): 10 min
- Scenes 3A & 3E & 5A-5C (All PM reactions): 20 min
- Scenes 2D montage (GitHub, Zoom, desk): 15 min
- Pick up shots / alternate takes: 15 min

**Block 2: Screen Recordings (20 min)**
- Pre-record Scene 3B-3F (Forge interface)
- This is done separately on a computer, not on set
- But discuss timing/flow while filming

### WRAP (10 min)
- Check all footage on camera
- Do 1-2 safety takes of key shots
- Backup footage immediately

## RECORDING BACKUP: "EASY MODE"

If you want to film faster:

**Option A: Voiceover Everything**
- Film PM silent (just reactions, expressions)
- Record all dialogue separately as voiceover
- Much easier to capture authentic expressions

**Option B: Film Yourself**
- You play the PM (fastest, no actor needed)
- Dialogue is more natural
- Tripod + phone is all you need

**Option C: Use Stock Footage**
- Record PM reactions only (no face/name visible)
- Hire voice actor on Fiverr (~$50)
- Speeds up production, still authentic

## CONTINGENCY PLANS

**If PM actor isn't available:**
- Film yourself (fastest)
- Hire actor on Fiverr for $50-100
- Use voiceover + silent PM reactions

**If lighting is bad:**
- Reschedule for different time of day (golden hour = best)
- Use ring light (even cheap one works)
- Film in overcast daylight (softest, most flattering)

**If audio is bad:**
- Record voiceover separately in a quiet room
- Add captions (required anyway for accessibility)
- Re-record any dialogue that's muffled

**If spec reveal is glitchy:**
- Pre-record the spec appearing (stop-motion style)
- Slow-mo the reveal (zooming into spec)
- Fade in section by section (problem → solution → API → tests)

---
