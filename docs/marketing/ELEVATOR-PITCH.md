# Forge Elevator Pitch
## Multiple Versions (Pick Your Length)

---

## VERSION 1: 10-Second Pitch (The Tweet)

> **Forge is an AI that writes engineering tickets so you don't have to.**
>
> Connect your GitHub repo, describe your feature, get a complete dev-ready spec in 5 minutes instead of 45.
>
> Free to try. No credit card.

---

## VERSION 2: 20-Second Pitch (The Intro)

> **Engineers spend 45 minutes writing vague tickets that developers still have questions about.**
>
> Forge reads your code, understands your architecture, and generates complete engineering specifications in 5 minutes. Every spec includes acceptance criteria, API changes, test plans, and file-by-file implementation guidance.
>
> It's like having a senior engineer write your tickets.

---

## VERSION 3: 30-Second Pitch (The One-Minute Version)

> **Writing engineering tickets is broken. Engineers spend hours writing incomplete specs that confuse developers and slow down shipping.**
>
> Forge fixes this. Connect your GitHub repo, describe what you want to build, and AI generates a complete, developer-ready specification in seconds. Not vague. Not incomplete. Complete: acceptance criteria, API changes, test plans, file-by-file guidance.
>
> We've cut ticket writing from 45 minutes to 5 minutes. The quality? Way higher.
>
> Free tier: 5 tickets a month. Pro: unlimited.

---

## VERSION 4: 45-Second Pitch (The Full Elevator)

> **The problem: Writing engineering tickets is broken.**
>
> Engineers spend 45 minutes writing vague specifications. Developers read them and have 10 clarifying questions. The feature ships late. The spec becomes outdated. Rinse, repeat.
>
> **Our solution: Forge.**
>
> Forge is AI that reads your code, understands your architecture, and generates complete engineering specifications in 5 minutes. Not vague. Complete: acceptance criteria in Given/When/Then format, detected API endpoints with routes and payloads, a complete test plan with unit and integration tests, and file-by-file implementation guidance organized by architectural layer.
>
> We're targeting PMs who write specs without coding skills, engineering leads who review and validate specs, and developers who are tired of guessing what "done" means.
>
> **Traction:** Freemium model, $19/month for unlimited. Early users are shipping 2x faster with 90%+ spec quality.

---

## VERSION 5: Business/Investor Pitch (60 Seconds)

> **The Problem**
>
> Technical specification writing is a bottleneck in software development. Engineering teams spend 5-10 hours per week writing incomplete tickets that still require back-and-forth clarification with developers. This delays feature shipping, increases context-switching, and damages team efficiency.
>
> **The Solution**
>
> Forge is an AI-powered specification generator that analyzes your codebase and generates complete, developer-ready specifications in minutes instead of hours.
>
> **How It Works**
>
> Users connect their GitHub repo (we read the code once), describe a feature in natural language, and Forge generates a complete spec: acceptance criteria (Given/When/Then), API endpoint detection, test plans, and layered file changes organized by architecture.
>
> **Market Opportunity**
>
> Our beachhead is product managers and engineering leaders at startups and mid-market companies. We're focusing on the $4.2B project management software market where spec quality is a persistent pain point.
>
> **Monetization**
>
> Freemium model: Free (5 tickets/month), Pro ($19/month unlimited), Team ($49/month per seat with team workspace), Enterprise (custom pricing with SLA).
>
> **Competitive Advantage**
>
> We don't just generate specs—we generate code-aware specs by analyzing actual repositories. Our specs respect project guardrails (CLAUDE.md, ESLint rules, CI constraints). Export integrations (Linear, Jira) lock in network effects.

## VERSION 6: Developer-Focused Pitch (30 Seconds)

> **Tired of writing vague tickets that developers hate?**
>
> Forge reads your code and generates specs that actually make sense. No more "Can you be more specific?" Back-and-forth. No more guessing at API structures or test cases. You get a complete, code-aware spec in 5 minutes.
>
> For PMs who don't code, it's magic. For engineers, it's obvious. Connect your repo, describe your feature, ship faster.

---

## VERSION 7: Competitor Conversation Pitch (45 Seconds)

> **Why Forge, not [Linear/Jira/Notion]?**
>
> Those tools manage your workflow—where tickets live, who's assigned, what's shipped. Forge solves a different problem: **writing better tickets in the first place.**
>
> We analyze your actual code to generate specifications, not templates. You get acceptance criteria that makes sense for your architecture, API changes that match your backend, test plans that match your stack, and file-by-file guidance.
>
> Think of it this way: Linear is where tickets go. Forge is how they get good before they arrive. We integrate with Linear, so it's not either/or—it's both.

## DELIVERY TIPS

**Pace:**
- Speak naturally, not robotic
- Pause after the problem (let it sink in)
- Lean into the solution (this is where you smile)
- End confident (not asking for permission)

**Tone:**
- Version 1-3: Casual, helpful, honest
- Version 4: Professional but conversational
- Version 5: Confident, metrics-driven, strategic
- Version 6: Peer-to-peer, "I get your pain"
- Version 7: Positioning, not defensive

**Body Language:**
- Open posture (not crossed arms)
- Make eye contact
- Lean in slightly when describing the problem (they relate)
- Lean back when describing the solution (you own it)

---

## PRACTICE THESE

Pick **one version** for each context you'll be in:
- [ ] Casual conversation: Version 2 or 3
- [ ] Professional meeting: Version 4 or 5
- [ ] Technical audience: Version 6
- [ ] Competitive comparison: Version 7

Practice each one 5 times until it feels natural (not scripted).
