## THE SCRIPT

**[0-5 SEC: THE SETUP]**

**[PM at desk, blank Jira ticket]**

**PM (to camera):**
> "Okay, we need to add a user avatar. How hard can it be?"
>
> *[types: "Add user avatar"]*

**[5-15 SEC: THE PROBLEM]**

**[Dev Slack appears]**

**DEV MESSAGE:**
> "Where does this live? Frontend? Backend? Database? What's the API endpoint?"

**PM (sighing, defeated):**
> "I... don't know."

**[Rapid cuts: PM Googling, confused, calling tech lead, rewriting ticket]**

**TEXT ON SCREEN:**
> ⏱️ 45 minutes
> ❓ Still incomplete

**[15-35 SEC: THE REVEAL — THE HERO MOMENT]**

**[Same PM, new tab open: Forge]**

**PM (hopeful):**
> "Wait... what if I just... paste the repo?"

**[Screen recording: Paste GitHub URL → "Analyzing..." animation → BOOM]**

**[Spec materializes on screen with all sections visible]**
- Problem Statement
- Solution
- Acceptance Criteria
- Backend Changes (with API endpoint)
- Frontend Changes
- Test Plan
- Quality Score: 92/100

**[PM's face: genuine shock]**

**PM (reading):**
> "It... it has everything. The API endpoint. The database schema. Test cases?"

**[35-50 SEC: THE CONTRAST]**

**[SPLIT SCREEN]**

**LEFT:** "Without Forge" — Vague ticket, confused dev, ⏱️ 45 min
**RIGHT:** "With Forge" — Complete spec, ready dev, ⏱️ 5 min

**VOICEOVER:**
> "The ticket developers actually want to read."

**[50-60 SEC: CTA]**

**[Forge logo appears]**

**VOICEOVER:**
> "Paste your repo. Get a complete spec in minutes."

**TEXT ON SCREEN:**
> **forge.dev.ai**
> Free. No credit card.

**[PM (smiling, closing laptop)]:**
> "Never writing a ticket manually again."

**[FADE]**

## PRODUCTION CHECKLIST

✅ **Shots needed:**
- PM confused at desk (2 wide, 1 close-up)
- GitHub/Forge screen recording (2 clips)
- Dev Slack message (text overlay)
- PM's reaction face (close-up during spec reveal)
- Split-screen before/after (quick cuts)

✅ **Audio:**
- Comedic fail horn (confusion section)
- Satisfying "ding" (reveal moment)
- Uplifting background music
- Natural PM dialogue (ad-lib is fine)

✅ **Timing:**
- Confusion montage: FAST (show time passing)
- Spec reveal: SLOW (let people absorb it)
- Contrast: quick, visual
- Total: exactly 60 seconds

---

## THAT'S IT

Shoot it, share it everywhere. People will tag their friends and say "this is literally me."

## FILMING NOTES

### Casting
- **The PM:** 25-35 years old, relatable, can convey frustration and relief convincingly
- **The Dev (voice only/Slack message):** Can be automated or a quick Slack notification

### Key Shots to Capture

**Act I (Confused PM):**
1. Wide shot: PM at desk, looking at blank ticket
2. Close-up: PM's face (confused, scrolling GitHub, Googling)
3. Screen recording: Jira interface with vague tickets
4. Screen recording: GitHub codebase confusion
5. Close-up: PM drinking coffee, defeated

**Act II (With Forge):**
1. Wide shot: PM opening Forge in new tab
2. Screen recording: Forge interface (paste repo, describe feature)
3. Screen recording: Analysis animation (fingerprinting)
4. **THE HERO SHOT:** Full tech spec appearing/materializing
5. Close-up: PM's face lighting up as spec reveals
6. Screen recording: Scrolling through complete spec sections
7. Wide shot: PM satisfied, leaning back

### Production Tips

**Audio:**
- Record PM dialogue naturally (slight ad-lib is better than stiff scripting)
- Add comedic SFX: failure horns, sad violin, satisfying "ding"
- Use uplifting background music for Act II (contrast is key)
- Voiceover can be you or a professional narrator (slightly wry tone works best)

**Editing:**
- Fast cuts during "confused PM" montage (ADD SPEED to show passage of time)
- Slow down during "Forge" reveal (LET PEOPLE ABSORB THE SPEC)
- Use split-screen for Before/After comparison (very visual, hits hard)
- Color grade: Act I = desaturated/cool, Act II = warm/vibrant (psychological impact)

**Pacing:**
- Act I should feel rushed, chaotic, frustrating (faster cuts, faster music)
- Act II should feel smooth, effortless, satisfying (slower cuts, uplifting music)
- The contrast in pacing SELLS the product

### Length Targets
- **Act I (Without Forge):** 50-60 seconds
- **Act II (With Forge):** 50-60 seconds
- **Closing/CTA:** 10-15 seconds
- **Total: ~2 minutes** (perfect for YouTube, TikTok, Twitter, Hacker News)

## ALTERNATE VERSIONS

### Version 1.5: Quick Cut (60 seconds)
If you need a faster version for social media, condense:
- Act I: 20 seconds (just the confusion, skip the montage)
- Act II: 30 seconds (faster reveal, focus on final spec)
- CTA: 10 seconds

### Version 2: Mockumentary Style
Instead of scripted, interview the PM:
- **Q:** "Tell me about the last ticket you wrote"
- **PM:** [Honest, frustrated answer about writing specs]
- **Q:** "How long did it take?"
- **PM:** "Like... 45 minutes? And the dev still had questions."
- **[Cut to: PM using Forge, genuine reactions]**
- **PM:** "This is insane. This is like... magic."

This feels more authentic and less "ad-y."

### Version 3: Multi-PM Montage
Show 2-3 different PMs (PM, Tech Lead, Startup Founder):
- Each has their own version of "confused PM" moment
- All discover Forge and react genuinely
- Cut between them, show variety of use cases

---

## WHY THIS WORKS

✅ **Relatability:** Every PM/founder has felt this pain
✅ **Emotion:** Frustration → relief is a powerful journey
✅ **Honesty:** Self-deprecating humor builds trust
✅ **Visual proof:** Show the actual spec output (not abstract features)
✅ **Clear contrast:** Before/After is unmissable
✅ **Memorable:** People tell friends about funny videos
✅ **Shareable:** This hits Hacker News + Twitter/X naturally

---

## DISTRIBUTION PLAN

1. **YouTube:** Full 2-minute version + community post with link
2. **Twitter/X:** 60-second cut with text: "Ever written a vague ticket?"
3. **Hacker News:** Post with link to YouTube, title: "Forge: Write better tickets in 5 minutes (we made a video)"
4. **LinkedIn:** PM-focused cut, caption: "PMs: How many hours a week do you spend writing incomplete specs?"
5. **TikTok/Short-form:** 30-second snippet of the "reveal moment"
6. **Product Hunt:** Embed in launch post + comment with link
7. **Your landing page:** Hero section, autoplay without sound
8. **Slack/Discord dev communities:** "We made something for PMs who are tired of writing specs..."

## SCRIPT VARIATIONS (If You Want Dialogue Options)

### Version A: Self-Aware Humor
**PM:** "I have no idea what I'm doing. I'll ask the developer to write it."
**DEV:** [Slack] "That's literally my job you're describing."
**PM:** "Right. But... my job?"

### Version B: The Time Crunch
**PM:** "Boss wants the feature by Friday. Ticket is due NOW."
**[Montage of PM frantically Googling]**
**PM:** "Okay I'm just gonna... guess at the API structure?"
**DEV:** [next day] "This API doesn't exist."

### Version C: The Team Conflict
**PM:** "I wrote a ticket for backend work."
**TECH LEAD:** [on call] "This is a frontend thing."
**PM:** "Oh. So I... was wrong?"
**TECH LEAD:** "Very."

## FINAL THOUGHT

The "confused PM" angle is **genius** because:
1. It's honest (everyone feels this way)
2. It's funny (relatability = laughter = share-ability)
3. It shows the pain vividly (emotional hook)
4. It makes the solution feel inevitable (not salesy, just obvious)
5. It positions Forge as a **helper, not a replacement** (you still write the description, we fill in the technical details)

This video should feel like a funny, honest conversation with a friend, not a polished sales pitch. That's when it converts.
