# RISKS
# =====
risks:
  - risk: "Stripe integration complexity (webhook reliability, edge cases)"
    mitigation: "Use Stripe Checkout hosted page, minimize custom code"
    probability: "Low"

  - risk: "Linear/Jira OAuth approval process for marketplace listing"
    mitigation: "Start with API key auth, upgrade to OAuth later"
    probability: "Medium"

  - risk: "RAG accuracy for codebase Q&A (Epic 15)"
    mitigation: "Start with repo README + docs only, expand sources incrementally"
    probability: "Medium"
