# CURRENT BLOCKERS & RISKS
# ========================
blockers:
  epic-2:
    blocker: "Story 2.5: Edge cases in answer validation"
    impact: "HIGH - unblocks 6 epics"
    resolution: "Add comprehensive test coverage, handle null/empty cases"
    priority: "P0"

  epic-9:
    blocker: "Story 9.5-9.6: Integration testing between wizard & analysis"
    impact: "MEDIUM - needed for MVP launch"
    resolution: "End-to-end testing, error scenario coverage"
    priority: "P0"

risks:
  - risk: "Deep-analysis LLM accuracy (Phase 2)"
    mitigation: "Test with diverse repos, fallback to regex analyzer"
    probability: "Medium"

  - risk: "Mastra workspace complexity (Phase 5)"
    mitigation: "Early POC with sandbox setup"
    probability: "Medium"

# DECISION POINTS
# ===============
decisions:
  next_path: "Confirm PATH A: Production Quality First"
  next_epic: "Epic 2.5 final polish"
  rollout_strategy: "MVP launch after Phase 2, then gradual feature rollout"

# NOTES FOR NEXT STANDUP
# ======================
standup_notes: |
  ✅ Documentation cleanup complete (ef3c6af, 4758b35)
  ✅ Epic 9 deep-analysis implemented (adb1a5b)
  🟡 Epic 2 at 80% (needs 2.5 final touches)
  🟡 Epic 9 at 70% (needs integration testing)

  🎯 Next:
  1. Confirm execution PATH (A recommended)
  2. Pick first epic to execute
  3. Create development tickets
  4. Begin work

  🚀 Ready to ship MVP in 4-5 weeks if focusing on Epic 2 + 9
